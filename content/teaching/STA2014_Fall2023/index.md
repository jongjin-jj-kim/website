# Principles of Statistics: My First Course of Teaching

## Overview
In Fall 2023, I had the privilege of teaching **STA 2014: Principles of Statistics** at the University of Central Florida. This course introduced students to fundamental statistical concepts, covering topics such as descriptive statistics, probability, and inferential statistics.

## Course Activities
Throughout the semester, students engaged in activities designed to deepen their understanding of statistical methods, including:
- Weekly problem sets and quizzes.
- In-class worksheets that promoted hands-on learning.

## Selected Student Comments from the Student Perception of Instruction (SPI)
I am grateful for the positive feedback from my students, which highlights the impact of my teaching approach:
- *"I liked how nice he was and how he tried his best to explain everything."*
- *"I've struggled with learning math my whole life, and the professor made learning statistics much easier."*
- *"What I liked best about the course was how helpful my teacher was during class. Whenever I or any of my classmates had a question, he was very quick to help us either one-on-one or in front of the class."*

## Teaching Philosophy
My teaching philosophy centers around active learning. I allocate the last 10 minutes of each class for students to practice examples using worksheets, helping to reinforce the day's concepts.

## Challenges and Reflections
The latter part of the course relied heavily on computations using external tools. While I introduced these tools as I found them, they were not fully integrated into the course structure, which posed a challenge for both the students and myself.
