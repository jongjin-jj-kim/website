# Principles of Statistics: Course Improvement

## Overview
In Spring 2024, I had the opportunity to teach **STA 2014: Principles of Statistics** again at the University of Central Florida. This semester brought new challenges, notably a smaller classroom space and the absence of a document camera, which made reviewing worksheets more difficult. Additionally, I had two older students who struggled with the mathematical content, both of whom informed me that it took them over 20 hours to complete the first homework. My goal was to ensure that no student was left behind. Based on feedback from the previous semester, I integrated more practical use of the statistical tool **StatCrunch**, which was well-received by the students.

## Course Activities
Throughout the semester, students participated in activities aimed at reinforcing their understanding of statistical methods, including:
- Weekly problem sets and quizzes.
- In-class **StatCrunch** exercises, replacing external tools to streamline learning.
- I provided a review sample questions before the exam

## Student Feedback on RateMyProfessor
I received comments on RateMyProfessor for the first time, and I am grateful for the positive feedback, which highlights the impact of my teaching approach:
- *"Very chill. Anytime I had an issue with an assignment, he would give me help and extra time. Super easy A if you're willing to learn basic statistics. #Caring #Accessible_outside_class #Online_Savvy"*
- *"This was my favorite professor at UCF so far. He is very understanding and will reopen assignments if there are technical issues. He also has very good lectures and makes them easy to understand. Attendance is not mandatory but I highly suggest it because his lectures make it much easier to comprehend. He is also overall extremely nice and funny. #Amazing_Lectures #Gives_Good_Feedback #Caring"*

## Challenges and Reflections
One challenge I encountered was low classroom attendance, as attendance was not mandatory. This resulted in students missing out on important in-class exercises, and even some students not participating in the **Student Perception of Instruction (SPI)** survey, which accounted for 2% of their final grade. Additionally, I noticed a discrepancy between homework and quiz performance on **MyLab** compared to the content of my lectures. I plan to address this in future courses by aligning these assessments more closely with my lectures.
